# bigelow-random-password-generator

## Description
This project was the first UCD code bootcamp project involving JavaScript. It was a refactoring project, so it came with starter code. I didn't change the HTML or the CSS, only the JavaScript. I had a small starting template to work with on the javascript. 

The purpose of the application was to take the human mental labor out of creating a password. 

I learned a lot of things while building this, but what stood out to me the most was the scope of possibilities for manipulating arrays. In addition, I gained a more practical understanding of JavaScript conditionals. 

## Usage
-To generate your random password, click the "generate" button.
-You will be asked how long you want your password to be. Type in a number between 8 and 128. Click "OK" or press "Enter".
-You will be presented with a series of prompts asking which kinds of characters you wish to use. With each prompt, click "OK" to confirm you wish to use that kind of character and "Cancel" to omit that character.
-Your password will appear in the text area above the "Generate" button.


## Credits
-This video by Paul Keldsen was extremely useful for getting a conceptual foothold. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4HUaiazDes
-Credit to the UCD Code Bootcamp for the starter code, specifically the HTML and CSS, as well as the JavaScript starting template. 

## Features
